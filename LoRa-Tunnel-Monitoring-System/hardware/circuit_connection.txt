Circuit Connection for Transmitter Node:

Arduino Uno:
- DHT11 VCC → 5V
- DHT11 GND → GND
- DHT11 OUT → Digital Pin 2

- MQ-2 VCC → 5V
- MQ-2 GND → GND
- MQ-2 OUT → Analog Pin A0

- LoRa:
   - VCC → 3.3V
   - GND → GND
   - MISO → Pin 12
   - MOSI → Pin 11
   - SCK  → Pin 13
   - NSS  → Pin 10
   - RESET → Pin 9
   - DIO0  → Pin 2

Circuit Connection for Receiver Node:

Same LoRa connection as above.

Optional:
- Connect LoRa receiver to Raspberry Pi via USB and read data using Serial.
- Python script sends received data to ThingSpeak.
