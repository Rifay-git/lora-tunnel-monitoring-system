Project: LoRa-based Tunnel Worker Safety System

Overview:
This system uses LoRa communication to monitor environmental safety for tunnel workers. It includes:
- A transmitter node (placed every 150 meters)
- A central receiver
- Cloud data visualization via ThingSpeak

Architecture:
[Sensor] → Arduino → LoRa Transmitter → 🛰️ → LoRa Receiver → Serial Monitor + ThingSpeak (via Pi)

Why LoRa?
- Long range (~10km line-of-sight)
- Low power
- No need for GSM or wired infrastructure
